        In 2015, the Liberal candidate for Orléans was elected with 46 542
        votes. In the same election, the candidate for Labrador won with 8 878
        votes. The catch here is that one candidate represents over 46 000
        people, and the other represents only 9 000. How could this possibly be
        fair? Well, it’s not. This is the harsh reality of our current electoral
        system. As long as first-past-the-post is in place, most of us won’t be
        able to cast our opinions through the ballot. In 2011, only a quarter of
        Canadian voters were represented through their winning Conservative
        candidate, and the other three quarters had virtually no effect. In
        2019, the Bloc Quebecois got their hands on 32 seats with only 7.7% of
        the popular vote, and yet the NDP only held on to 24 seats with 15.9%.
        This ends up coercing voters into a two-party system instead of voting
        for their favored party, since they know only one or the other will be
        able to win. We need a diverse government that suits the needs of all
        voters. It's time to make elections fair.
