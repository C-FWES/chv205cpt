        We all know Justin Trudeau is no stranger to breaking electoral
        promises. From supplying clean water to Indigenous communities, to
        budget deficits, his string of mishaps seems to never end. Back during
        the 2015 election campaign, he promised to abolish the
        first-past-the-post system, but of course, two elections later, still no
        change has occurred. This is a concurrent example of how the Liberal
        government continually fails Canadians every step of the way. Research
        conducted by the Angus Reid institute finds that three in five Canadians
        would have preferred an election using the proportional representation
        model. Not only has Trudeau deterred his reform plans, he also has
        completely switched sides on the issue. During the 2021 campaign, he
        told media that he would not favor proportional representation as the
        electoral system, and instead was looking into a ranked ballot. As
        always, Trudeau decided to decept Canadians and voters alike with his
        false claims.
