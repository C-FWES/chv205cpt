        Let’s face it. The current electoral system is flawed. Canadian citizens
        are being denied their fair share of representation in our
        first-past-the-post system. We are being squashed into voting for who we
        think will win instead of freely voicing our opinions. Now, you might be
        wondering, what can we do to ensure fair representation for all? The
        answer is as simple as it gets - proportional representation. This means
        that everyone, no matter where they live, will be able to contribute
        their opinion to form a well constructed government. The new reform
        would abolish several issues, including finally respecting the popular
        vote. In the 2021 election, the Conservative party received 33.7% of the
        popular vote, yet the Liberals amassed a victory with only 32.6% of the
        vote. This is in no way ethical or fair to Canadian voters, and it is
        time that we come together to push for reform. Our votes are what define
        our country - let’s make them count.
